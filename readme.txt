== Frequently Asked Questions ==


= Can I chat with my ipad or smart phone?  =

Sure, you can add the chat to your website or blog and talk from anywhere.

= Can I manage more than a single chat in my account?  =

Yes, RumbleTalk is group oriented. This means you define a group (logical name) and within a group you define as many 
chats as you like (premium feature). You can integrate it on different domains.

= I want my users to login only with Facebook logins, is it possible? =
Sure. As admin you can decide how users will login. 
Only as facebook users, as anonymous users, with user names and passwords you define for them or any combination of the 3. 

= Can I have different designs for different chats? =
Yes you can, For each chat choose a design or create a design with our chat template builder.

= My chat height is too small? =

RumbleTalk chat is elastic chat. It means it will consume
all the space around it. If that does not work try to use a direct embed (see next question how)

= Can I use direct embed in an html page? =
 
Sure, you can go to Source of your page and copy paste a code that looks like that.
Just replace the "chatcode" with your own 8 digit code.

RumbleTalk FREE Trial chat is limited to 7 days and we certainly won't sell your email address to spammers either, or anything like that. We do have various premium packages. 

The FREE trial is limited to 4 simultaneous chatters. The RumbleTalk chat is AD FREE. The Premium version allows you to talk with more simultaneous chatters, have private chat, moderation rights, css editing, chat archiving and offline mode.
