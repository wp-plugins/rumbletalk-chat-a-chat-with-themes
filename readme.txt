== Frequently Asked Questions ==


= Can i chat with my ipad or smart phone?  =

Sure, you can add the chat to your website or blog and talk from anywhere.

= Can i manage more than a single chat in my account?  =

Yes, RumbleTalk is group oriented. This means you define a group (logical name) and within a group you define as many 
chats as you like. You can integrate it on different domains.

= I want my users to login only with Facebook logins, is it possible? =
Sure. As admin you can decide how users will login. 
Only as facebook users, as anonymous users, with user names and passwords you define for them or any combination of the 3. 

= Can I have different designs for different chats? =
Yes you can, For each chat choose a design or create a design with our chat template builder.

= My chat height is too small? =

RumbleTalk chat is elastic chat. It means it will consume
all the space around it. If that does not work try to use a direct embed (see next question how)

= Can I use direct embed in an html page? =
 
Sure, you can go to Source of your page and copy paste a code that looks like that.
Just replace the "chatcode" with your own 8 digit code.
