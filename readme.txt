      * After that you will be redirected to your chat page.

Configure the plugin in the WordPress administration panel:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. On the left hand side menu click "Settings" and then click "RumbleTalk Chat".

Add the chat in your post and pages
----------------------------------------------------
